# Strong-Data-Visualization

Small data analysis project using personal data gathered from the training app Strong.
Ideas for analysis:
1. Total number of workouts (between dates).
2. Number of different exercises (between dates).
3. Plot the calculated 1RM for different exercises over time.
4. Calculate the (average) total volume for different training days
5. Perform linear regession for the 1RM and predict future values.
